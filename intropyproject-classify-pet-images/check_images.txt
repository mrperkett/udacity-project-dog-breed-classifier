Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

Model Architecture  |   Classification of Dog_01.jpg
----------------------------------------------------
AlexNet             |   dingo, warrigal, warragal, canis dingo
RESNET	            |   dingo, warrigal, warragal, canis dingo
VGG16	            |   dingo, warrigal, warragal, canis dingo

All model architectures labeled the image as a dingo.  Although not correct, isn’t too far off since the dog does look like a dingo. 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

Model Architecture	|   Classification of Dog_02.jpg
----------------------------------------------------
AlexNet             |   Pomeranian
RESNET	            |   eskimo dog, husky
VGG16               |   golden retriever

All model architectures labeled the image as a dog this time, but they all differed on breed (see table above).


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 

Model Architecture	|  Classification of Cat_01.jpg
----------------------------------------------------
AlexNet	            |   cardigan, cardigan welsh corgi, corgi
RESNET              |	egyptian cat, cat
VGG16               |   plastic bag


Model Architecture	|   Classification of Sailboat_01.jpg
---------------------------------------------------------
AlexNet             |   suspension bridge
RESNET	            |   catamaran
VGG16	            |   catamaran


The only false positive “dog” classification was by AlexNet, which thought Cat_01.jpg was a corgi.



4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:

The model architecture that performed the best on the uploaded photos was RESNET.  Based on classifying an image as “dog” vs “not dog”, either VGG16 or RESNET would be acceptable choices since only AlexNet classified a non-dog (Cat_01) as a dog.  I have selected RESNET as the best performing since
    - It did equally well as the other models on Dog_01 (all misclassified as a dingo)
    - It is the closest model to the correct breed in Dog_02 (the dog is a husky mix)
    - It was the only model that correctly classified Cat_01
    - It did equally well with VGG16 on the Sailboat_01 classification (it’s not a catamaran, but it’s in the right ballpark)
